# Animated-EYE
We intend to launch a kind of TFT LCD with St7789 driver, as a result of which we will be able to display an interesting animation that simulates the function of the human eye.

## What it DO!
In this project, we will use the Wemos board with ESP8266 chip to set up the TFT display, the used TFT display with dimensions of 240 x 240, which due to its full color, contributes a lot to the beauty of the project. We will use the TFT-eSPI library to set up and display graphic items, but we will also make changes to the library to make it suitable for ESP8266 use.

### Items needed
-TFT LCD St7789
-Wemos
-LDR

### Required libraries
-TFT_eSPI
-SPI

## Conclusion
In this project, using the ESP8266 board, we will set up the ST7789 display with the aim of displaying the desired animation, and we will also be able to change the type of eye animation, and then add a light resistor to the circuit to make the animation type more natural. In this case, the amount of ambient light is measured by light resistance, and then the pupil of this eye will change in a certain period of time due to light changes. This project can be used for cases that require personalization of the robot.
